# Machine Learning based Pattern Recognition in Mission-critical Systems 
2021 S1 Capstone CS4-2
## Project description:
This project aims to discover meaningful patterns between mission-critical systems and their optimal scheduling strategies using machine learning. 
A mission-critical system can be represented as a vector of numeric parameters, and its corresponding optimal scheduling strategy is a well-designed sequence of instructions. 
There is a binding link between mission-critical systems and their optimal scheduling strategies, but the relation is unknown in advance.   
In this project, you will be given `a dataset containing rows`, and each row contains a pair. In each pair, it has `‘features’` and `‘the target sequence’`. 
You need to train `multiple machine learning models` to predict the targets given features, report all training processes, and the `performance` of the fine-tuned trained models.  
`Expected outcome:`  
• Source code for training the fine-tuned machine learning models  
• A report containing all training processes, and the performance of the fine-tuned trained models
